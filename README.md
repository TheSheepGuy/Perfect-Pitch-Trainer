# Perfect-Pitch-Trainer

This little tool helps you train yourself to recognise notes. Although you can't train yourself to get real perfect pitch (a.k.a. absolute pitch), but you can get very close to it. Since it uses Javascript, you can run it in your browser, by either downloading it; or by visiting this site (soonâ„¢).
